# Splatting Commands
There are two splatting commands included in the PSNotes module. There is ConvertTo-Splatting which will take an existing command and convert it to a splatting format. The other is Get-CommandSplatting. This will output the parameters for a command in splatting format, along with a set of variables for you to set the values with. 

* [ConvertTo-Splatting](ConvertTo-Splatting.MD)
* [Get-CommandSplatting](Get-CommandSplatting.MD)
